Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Vincent Rolea, a Software Engineer based in Roubaix, France, and here's my little corner of the Internet.

Currently, I work at [Getaround](https://getaround.com/) as a Senior Backend Engineer.

I write about Ruby, Rails, building [laterbox](https://laterbox.io) and (sometimes) interests of mine such as data-privacy, and screen addiction.
